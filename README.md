# RecipeManager
 This is project developed in the course: [62413 Advanced object oriented programming using C# and .NET](http://kurser.dtu.dk/course/62413).
 In general the course responsible did not have any requirements for the nature of any projects developed in this course. Only one thing, we would only be rated by the c# code that we handed in.
 Therefore I chose to create a WPF application, instead of a ASP.NET projects, since it seemed that a WPF application would contain more c# code and logic.

## What is this?
 This is a Windows Application build with WPF. It can manage recipes for food local on your computer.

---
## What can it do?
 It handles recipies. You can:
  - Add recipe categories, which can be used to divide recipies. The GUI can only handle a one-to-one relationship, but the DB can manage many-to-many.
  - Add recipies to category.
   - They can be added manually via the GUI.
   - They can be scraped from the web. Currently only recipies from [valdemarsro.dk](https://valdemarsro.dk) can be scraped.
  - Recipies and categories can be edited and deleted via the GUI.

## Other
 Feel free to use, modify or do what you want with the entire code base :D

## Disclaimer
 I have been a bit rushed under the development of this project. So yeah, it is what it is ;)
